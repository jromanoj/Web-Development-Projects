# Project #1
+http://eve.kean.edu/~romanoj/TECH3500/ppage.html
+This project was to showcase my portfolio, resume, and website in a way that I designed it without using Boostrap.

# Project #2
+http://eve.kean.edu/~romanoj/TECH3500/Home.html
+This web design project was based around creating an E-commerce website using Boostrap. I used boostrap to construct this website and give it my own design. It was created with responsiveness and user experience in mind. 

# Project #3
*http://eve.kean.edu/~romanoj/TECH3500/HomeK.html
*This final project was based around creating a new website for students to use at Kean University instead of a current outdated website called Kean Wise. This website includes class registration, an anual GPA chart, a home page with a focus on student life and personal student information. This would be a website students log into so that they can easily access all their important University information such as financial aid, student advisement, tutoring, tuition payments, and much more. This website was created using Bootstrap so it has responsiveness and user experience in mind.
